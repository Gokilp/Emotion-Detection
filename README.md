## **Introduction**

Emotion Detection project that utilizes artificial intelligence to recognize and classify human emotions from images or video streams. This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for understanding human emotions using deep learning techniques.

## **Features**

- Train your own emotion detection model using the provided **`train.py`** script.
- Easily customize the number of classes to detect different emotions according to your requirements.
- Experiment with different pre-trained models to achieve the best performance for your application.
- Utilize the **`test.py`** file to perform real-time emotion detection on images or video streams.
- Dive into the world of deep learning and explore the fascinating real of emotion recognition.

## **Usage**

1. **Training the Model:**

   - Use the **`train.py`** file to train your emotion detection model. You can modify the script to adjust parameters, architecture, or dataset according to your needs.

   ```bash
   bashCopy code
   python train.py

   ```

2. **Customization:**
   - Adjust the number of classes in the dataset and model architecture to accommodate different emotional states or expressions.
   - Experiment with various pre-trained models to find the most suitable one for your application.
3. **Real-time Emotion Detection:**

   - Execute the **`test.py`** script to perform real-time emotion detection on images or video streams.

   ```bash
   bashCopy code
   python test.py

   ```

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- OpenCV (for real-time image and video processing)
